# etiqa-assessment

This is for Assessment Purpose:

Clone or Download the app for

1) Client (Frontend)
2) Server (API)

Run both folder with 

### `npm start`

## Note: In root server folder, create .env file with below template:

```
DB_HOST=mongodb://0.0.0.0:27017/etiqa-assessment
PORT=3000
```


The app is running with basic CRUD. However, im stuck in Edit user function due to Angular complex state.

Enjoy!
